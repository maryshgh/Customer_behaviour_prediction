# Customer_behaviour_prediction
This is a code package related to the following project. In this project, the goal is to predict the bank customer decision on continuing using of the bank service or exiting. The following features are used for prediction: credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, having bank's credit card, being an active member, and estimated salary. A deep neural network has used for predicting the customer's decision on staying or leaving the bank. The network has an input layer of size of 10 (because we consider 10 features), 
This repository contains the Python code required to reproduces all the numerical results.

## Abstract of Article

We consider multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) at a common altitude serving as data collectors to a network of IoT devices. First, using a probabilistic line of sight channel model, the optimal assignment of IoT devices to the UAVs is determined. Next, for the asymptotic regimes of a large number of UAVs and/or large UAV altitudes, we propose closed-form analytical expressions for the optimal data rate and characterize the corresponding optimal UAV deployments. We also propose a simple iterative algorithm to find the optimal deployments with a small number of UAVs at high altitudes. Globally optimal numerical solutions to the general rate maximization problem are found using particle swarm optimization.
